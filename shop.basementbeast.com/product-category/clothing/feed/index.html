					<description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright BEAST….</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You absolutely blew our minds during the last shirt drop, so, by popular demand and just in time for the Holidays, it’s time for the “Boom Nice T” drop!</span>

<b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- keep in mind that this shirt is to be worn by BEASTS only -</span>

<b>IMPORTANT NOTIC</b><strong>E -</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">shirts will be available until Dec 14th and will ship on Dec 21th.</span>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Boom Nice T is made from 100% Combed Ring-Spun Cotton, just like the OG T (our last drop) was.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still have no idea what “Combed Ring-Spun Cotton” is, but what I do know is that it is an extremely comfortable, form fitting, flexible shirt that can be worn to show off those new gains while you work out or hit the town. I actually used to be sponsored by the company that we’ve now contracted to make these shirts for us, and I’ve had some of these for 2+ years and they still fit like new</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember &#8211; the Boom Nice T is to be worn by BEASTS ONLY &#8211; no exceptions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that we can only ship this shirt to our American based BEASTS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I know..I’m from Germany, so I feel your pain, but that’s just how it is for now ;/)</span></p>
